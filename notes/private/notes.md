# Notes

## Coming updates

We may consider turning the payload passed to Flask.applyMixer into a formal object susch that in case of having only one key, it's value can easily be   accesed like  `payload.object`

## todos

- remove high level api methods
- create FlaskNavLock
- asynchronous setup for controllers (protocol? viewDidload method swizzling?)
