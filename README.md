# What is Flask?
Flask is a framework implementing the Single-Flux- Reactive pattern using lab naming semantics.

## Motivation
Flask is designed with the following goals:

* Guarantee full atomicity during the state transformations
* Support both: Fluxxor and Redux patterns
* Create a DSL easy and fun to use requiring minimum boilerplate.

The naming semantics in Flask are built around four commonly used Laboratory concepts: Lab, Flask, Substance and State.
